<!--This is my first paragraph. It tell you about Lorem Ipsum-->
      <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1> 
<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br> 
industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br>
<strong><em><u>Aldus PageMaker</u></em></strong> including versions of <U>Lorem Ipsum.</U>1914 translation by H. Rackham</p>

<!--This is the translated version of the above text. I use blockquote to indent-->
<blockquote>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore <br>
    et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi <br>
ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse <br>
cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa <br>
qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. 
</blockquote>

<!--The below paragraphy tells you why do we use Lorem Ipsum-->
<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its <br>
layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br> 
using <q>Content here, content here,</q> making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br>
web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem Ipsum” will uncover <br>
many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>
sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>

<h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
<p>
    <b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered <br>
alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly<br>
believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <br>
 embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <em>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat <br> 
 predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</em> It uses a dictionary of over <br>
 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks <br>
 reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non- <br>
 characteristic words etc. </p>
